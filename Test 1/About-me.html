        <p><center> My name is Daniel Joo Wei Bessant and i come from Malaysia.
        <br> I was born on the 30th of novemeber in 2003 and my dad is
        <br>British from Bristol and my mum is malaysian chinese however
        <br>i am unable to speak chinese and english is my first language.
        <br> I am currently studying in Taylors College in Subang and I am
        <br>doing my diploma in IT. I decided to do my diploma in import
        <br>right after finishing my IGCSE. I decided upon doing IT aside
        <br>during my Highschool I found a passion for programming and wished
        <br>to persue it into the future.
        <br>Although Wasian and white skinned I am comfortable arnd others
        <br>although at times I am watched or picked out by strangers
        <br>I recognize malaysia as my home and do not wish to move abroad
        <br>in the meantime or anytime soon. I hope to finish my diploma
        <br>and move onto studying my degree and eventually my masters in IT.
        <br>I aim to oneday become a Software developer as giving up programming
        <br>is not something I wish to see one day.
        <br>I live in Pj, Gasing and have stayed here my whole life. I attended my
        <br>highschool in Sungai Buloh which was called elc.
        <br>I work comfortably with others and easily break tense enviroments to help
        <br>others ease into the team or group. I can easily communicate withing a group
        <br>sharing ideas as well as hearing out others input into projects or other work.
        <br>I personally feel that it is important for a group to get alone together in order
        <br>for there to be efficient and quality work as communication between each other
        <br>is key to finishing before the deadline.
