      <h2><u><b>My Schooling Life</b></u></h2>
      <p>Attenind my highschool in elc Internation School Sunagi Buloh I gradtuated
      <br>my IGCSE with 9 subjects, 4 of them being A, 4 being B's and the last resulting
      <br>in a C for my Bahasa Malaysia. The subjects I had decided upon taking were:
      <br>History, Physical Education, Physics, Music, Geography, History, Computer Science and Bahasa malaysia, English and Mathematics being compulsory subjects.
      <br>Whilst throughout my schooling life in elc, I participated frequently in Sports
      <br>comptetions representing my school abroad agaisnt other South East Asian schools in an Sport competition known as Fobisia.
      I was heavily involved in the sporting team throughout my schooling life taking part as a team player and winning medals
      for my team as well as being selected to be team captain. As I also found myself
      being attracted towards coding in my Computer Science classes I took part in a coding
      competition with 2 of my fellow friends to code out a game for the competition.
      <br>I studied and gained skills in my computer science class excelling in Python programming being able to gain
      important skills and understanding of different techniques and knowledge in order to problem solve and calculate problems.
      <br> Besides sports I also signed up, auditioned and participated in 3 plays that my school held landing 2 minor rolls as well
      as one semi-major roll as pumba in my schools lion King production play. I was able to easily memorize my lines and had
      clear and easy grasp of the acting techniques in order to capture the audience and to put on a good show. Whilst
      working in the production I learnt valuable skills such as one being able to improvise on the spot to be able to have the show
      or my work continue on without hessitation or stutter.
