        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p>During my free time at home I love to game, spending my time
          playing games such as League of Legends, Valorant, Minecraft,
          Factorio as well as Ghost of Tsushima.I also like to work out from
          home. As my mum is a personal trainer I have weights and a few workout
          equipment at home, so during the weekdays at 6:30pm I start my workout
          in order to keep fit and healthy as well as maintain my lifestyle.
          I enjoy going out with my friends to bars and cafes in order to
          experience new things and try new things as well. I love to make new
          friends and socialize with new people in order to learn about others
          lifestyle as well as different cultures. I enjoy driving no matter the
          distance especially at night. I enjoy star gazing and watching the moon
          and the night atmosphere.</p></div>
